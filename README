This program is SuVeTMA, a collection of support vector tools for microarray analysis.

The tools use two types of data as input:

* Regulatory network models. These can be created as follows:

1) BaSeTraM is run using the TRANSFAC database and the human genome. This will generate a list of locations in the genome of the putative transcription factor binding sites.

2) TFNetBuilder is run over the BaSeTraM output to associate the transcription factor binding sites to particular genes.

* Microarray data to test the regulatory model against. To get this, download a platform in SOFT format, and then use the soft2matrix format to convert it into the on-disk data-structure used by SuVeTMA.
